I added L and R versions of the interactions just in case there are left handed accessability options on the way.

Also, Falling/Flying effects are cool but might be a bit busy for this title. Included the tactfiles for falling/flying just in case, but I think they may be too much given you're always falling or flying.

DM me if you have any questions!
