I've included some specific recoil patterns for a few champions, but otherwise as a rule of thumb you'll use these recoil levels accordingly:

RecoilLevel1 - Sidearms
RecoilLevel2 - Primaries
RecoilLevel3 - Secondaries

A few effects have multiple files (like HeadshotHit_1, 2, 3 etc). These can be randomized to add some variety to the interactions.

Character specific patterns should start with thier names in all caps.

Feel free to reach out for clarification on any of this or modification/additional patterns!
