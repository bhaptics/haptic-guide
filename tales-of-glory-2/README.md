- Recoil Effect : Whenever the gun is triggered, it will feel more realistic if the recoil effect comes to the chest and shoulders.

- Rumble Effect : When an airplane passes in the sky, the rumble effect will improve the immersion.
- Healing Effect : When healed with a heal pack, it was a bit empty. It would be nice to have a haptic effect here as well.
